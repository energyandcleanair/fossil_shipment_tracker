## Purpose
Create a data platform that provides decision-makers (political, business, financial), journalists and campaigning organizations with information that helps identify fossil fuel shipments from Russia, scandalize them and create momentum to stop purchases.

## Deliverables
- Daily tracking of the tonnage of fossil fuel shipments departing from Russian ports, by destination (reported by ship upon departure). The purpose is to track shipment volumes on a daily basis on the country level.
- Identification of completed voyages (ship loads in a Russian port, transits to a port outside of Russia, unloads) with information on berth locations, vessel type and tonnage
- Identification of the shore facilities (handling terminal, refinery, power plantâ€¦) and the ownership and financiers of those facilities; identification of vessel owner, insurer etc. commercial ties
